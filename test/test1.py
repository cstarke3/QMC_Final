# As promised in class yesterday, I am providing here some numbers that you can use to check/benchmark your final-project implementations.  
# Specifically, I quote below the ground state energies E_0 for the same attractive Gaussian potential that was used in previous homework assignments, with 
# parameters V_0 = -4.0 and range R = 2.0.

# Note that even for two particles the ground-state energy below differs from the homework result because that calculation was performed for the 3D system with angular momentum 0, while now we are considering the system in 1D.

# n = 2 particles, E_0 = -3.094
# n = 3 particles, E_0 = -9.738
# n = 4 particles, E_0 = -20.046
